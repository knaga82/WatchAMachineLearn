You have heard about Machine Learning... but maybe you don't yet know what it looks like when a machine learns.  This is my attempt to help visualize (after simplifying) machine learning to the point that our brain can better comprehend what it might look like when a machine is learning from data!

Feel free to make comments and suggestions for improvements.

Thank you,
